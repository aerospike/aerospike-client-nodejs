  # Composite actions doesn't support step-level timeout-minutes
  # Use timeout command and store polling logic in file to make it easier to read
  # Call bash shell explicitly since timeout uses "sh" shell by default, for some reason
  # Also, we don't want to fail if we timeout in case the server *did* finish starting up but the script couldn't detect it due to a bug
  # Effectively, this composite action is like calling "sleep" that is optimized to exit early when it detects an ok from the server
