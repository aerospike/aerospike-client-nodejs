The Aerospike Node.js client is a Node.js add-on module, written using V8.

## Usage

The following is very simple example how to create, update, read and remove a
record using the Aerospike database.

```js
const Aerospike = require('aerospike')

const config = {
  hosts: '192.168.33.10:3000'
}
const key = new Aerospike.Key('test', 'demo', 'demo')

Aerospike.connect(config)
  .then(client => {
    const bins = {
      i: 123,
      s: 'hello',
      b: Buffer.from('world'),
      d: new Aerospike.Double(3.1415),
      g: Aerospike.GeoJSON.Point(103.913, 1.308),
      l: [1, 'a', {x: 'y'}],
      m: {foo: 4, bar: 7}
    }
    const meta = { ttl: 10000 }
    const policy = new Aerospike.WritePolicy({
      exists: Aerospike.policy.exists.CREATE_OR_REPLACE
    })

    return client.put(key, bins, meta, policy)
      .then(() => {
        const ops = [
          Aerospike.operations.incr('i', 1),
          Aerospike.operations.read('i'),
          Aerospike.lists.append('l', 'z'),
          Aerospike.maps.removeByKey('m', 'bar')
        ]

        return client.operate(key, ops)
      })
      .then(result => {
        console.log(result.bins) // => { i: 124, l: 4, m: null }

        return client.get(key)
      })
      .then(record => {
        console.log(record.bins) // => { i: 124,
                                 //      s: 'hello',
                                 //      b: <Buffer 77 6f 72 6c 64>,
                                 //      d: 3.1415,
                                 //      g: '{"type":"Point","coordinates":[103.913,1.308]}',
                                 //      l: [ 1, 'a', { x: 'y' }, 'z' ],
                                 //      m: { foo: 4 } }
      })
      .then(() => client.close())
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error: %s [%i]', error.message, error.code)
    if (error.client) {
      error.client.close()
    }
  })
```

## Prerequisites

The client is compatible with Node.js 10, 12 (LTS), 14 (LTS), 16 (LTS) and 18 (LTS). It
supports the following operating systems: CentOS/RHEL 7/8, Debian 8/9/10/11,
Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, as well as many Linux distributions compatible with one of
these OS releases. macOS is also supported. The client port to Windows is a
community supported project and suitable for application prototyping and
development.

The Aerospike Node.js client supports all Node.js [LTS
releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule). To download and
install the latest stable version of Node.js, visit
[nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) or use the version that comes bundled with
your operating system.

Ensure to install necessary "development tools" and other libraries to build the client software.

Reference various docker files in the repository under the docker / directory for more information.

#### CentOS/RHEL

To install library prerequisites using `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum group install "Development Tools" 
sudo yum install openssl openssl-devel
sudo yum install python3 python3-devel
```

#### Alpine Linux

```bash
apk add build-base \
    linux-headers \
    bash \
    libuv-dev \
    openssl-dev \
    lua5.1-dev \
    zlib-dev \
    git \
    python3
```

#### Amazon Linux

```bash
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install openssl openssl-devel
yum install python3 python3-devel
```

#### Debian

To install library prerequisites using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt -y install software-properties-common
sudo apt -y install build-essential
sudo apt -y install libssl-dev
sudo apt -y install libarchive-dev cmake rsync curl libcurl4-openssl-dev zip
sudo apt -y install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev -y
sudo apt -y install wget libtool m4 automake
```

#### Ubuntu

To install library prerequisites using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ libssl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### macOS (Intel)

Before starting with the Aerospike Nodejs Client, verify that you have the following prerequisites:

- macOS 10.8 or greater.
- Xcode 5 or greater.

### macOS (M1 Chip)

Currently the C library does not support M1, so you cannot install Aerospike Nodejs Client directly on your mac, see [Issue](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-nodejs/issues/430).
As a workaround, you can build your app inside of Docker before using `--platform` [option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).
Example of a working docker-compose.yaml file looks similar to this:
```
version: '2.4'
services:
  my-node-js-app:
    build: .
    platform: linux/amd64
```

**Openssl Library**

The below example shows how to install the Openssl library.

```bash
$ brew install openssl
$ brew link openssl --force
$ unlink /usr/local/opt/openssl
$ # Change the below linking based on openssl version and installation path
$ ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl@x/y.z/ /usr/local/opt/openssl
```
For 4x client support, install openssl&#64;1.1 version.

**LIBUV Library**

The example below shows how to install the LIBUV library.

```bash
$ brew install libuv
$ brew link libuv --force
$ unlink /usr/local/opt/libuv
$ # Change the below linking based on libuv version and installation path
$ ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/libuv/1.44.1_1/ /usr/local/opt/libuv
```

## Installation

The Aerospike Node.js client is an add-on module that uses the Aerospike C client. The installation will attempt to install the pre-built binaries including dependent C client.

You can install the Aerospike Node.js client like any other Node.js module.

### Primer on Node.js Modules

Node.js modules are containers of JavaScript code and a `package.json`, which defines
the module, its dependencies and requirements. Modules are usually installed as
dependencies of other Node.js applications or modules. The modules are installed in
the application's `node_modules` directory, and can be utilized within the program
by requiring the module by name.

### npm Registry Installations

To install `aerospike` as a dependency of your project, in your project directory run:

```bash
$ npm install aerospike
```

To add `aerospike` as a dependency in _package.json_, run:

```bash
$ npm install aerospike --save-dev
```

To require the module in your application:
```bash
const Aerospike = require('aerospike')
```

### Git Repository Installations

When using a cloned repository, install `aerospike` as a dependency of your application. Instead of referencing the module by name, you reference it by path.

To clone the repository use the following command:

	$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:aerospike/aerospike-client-nodejs.git

#### Building dependancy C client

Make sure to build the C client before doing npm install variants
Run the following commands to build the C client:

	$ ./scripts/build-c-client.sh

To install the module as a dependency of your application, run the following in the application directory:

```bash
$ npm install --unsafe-perm --build-from-source
```

To require it in the application:

```bash
const Aerospike = require('aerospike')
```

## Documentation

Access the client API documentation at:
[http://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/nodejs](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/nodejs).
This documentation is built from the client's source using [JSDocs
v3](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html) for every release.

The API docs also contain a few basic tutorials:

* [Getting Started - Connecting to an Aerospike database cluster](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/nodejs/tutorial-getting_started.html)
* [Managing Aerospike connections in a Node cluster](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/nodejs/tutorial-node_clusters.html)
* [Handling asynchronous database operations using Callbacks, Promises or `async`/`await`](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/nodejs/tutorial-callbacks_promises_async_await.html)

A variety of additional example applications are provided in the
[`examples`](examples) directory of this repository.

Access backward incompatible API changes by a release at:
https://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/nodejs/usage/incompatible.html.

### API Versioning

The Aerospike Node.js client library follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
By Aerospike versioning guidelines, changes which may break backwards compatibility are
indicated by an increase in the major version number.
Minor, or patch releases, which are incremented only the
second and third version number, are always backwards compatible.


## Tests

The client includes a comprehensive test suite using
[Mocha](http://mochajs.org). The tests can be found in the repository under test directory.

Before running the tests, you need to update the dependencies:

    $ npm update

To run all the test cases:

    $ npm test

To run the tests and also report on test coverage:

    $ npm run coverage
