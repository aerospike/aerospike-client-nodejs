 *
 * @summary Release event loop resources held by the module, which could keep
 * the Node.js event loop from shutting down properly.
 *
 * @description This method releases some event loop resources held by the
 * Aerospike module and the Aerospike C client library, such as libuv handles
 * and timers. If not released, these handles will prevent the Node.js event
 * loop from shutting down, i.e. it will keep your application from
 * terminating.
 *
 * The Aerospike module keeps an internal counter of active {@link Client}
 * instances, i.e. instances which have not been <code>close()</code>'d yet. If
 * a client is closed and the counter reaches zero, this method will be called
 * automatically, unless {@link Client#close} is called with
 * <code>releaseEventLoop</code> set to <code>false</code>. (The default is
 * <code>true</code>.)
 *
 * If an application needs to create multiple client instance, i.e. to connect
 * to multiple, different clusters, the event loop resources will be managed
 * automatically, as long as at least once client instance is active at any
 * given time, until the application terminates.
 *
 * If, however, there could be one or more intermittent time periods, during
 * which no client is active (i.e. the internal client counter reaches zero),
 * then the clients need to be closed with <code>releaseEventLoop</code> set
 * to <code>false</code> and the event loop needs to be released explicitly by
 * calling <code>releaseEventLoop()</code>.
