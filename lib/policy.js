/**
 * @module aerospike/policy
 *
 * @description The policy module defines policies and policy values that
 * define the behavior of database operations. Most {@link Client} methods,
 * including scans and queries, accept a policy object, that affects how the
 * database operation is executed, by specifying timeouts, transactional
 * behavior, etc. Global defaults for specific types of database operations can
 * also be set through the client config, when a new {@link Client} instance is
 * created.
 *
 * Different policies apply to different types of database operations:
 *
 * * {@link ApplyPolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#apply}.
 * * {@link BatchPolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#batchRead} as well as the
 *   deprecated {@link Client#batchExists}, {@link Client#batchGet}, and {@link
 *   Client#batchSelect} operations.
 * * {@link InfoPolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#info}, {@link
 *   Client#infoAny}, {@link Client#infoAll} as well as {@link
 *   Client#createIndex}, {@link Client#indexRemove}, {@link Client#truncate},
 *   {@link Client#udfRegister} and {@link Client#udfRemove}.
 * * {@link ListPolicy} - Applies to List operations defined in {@link module:aerospike/lists}.
 * * {@link MapPolicy} - Applies to Map operations defined in {@link module:aerospike/maps}.
 * * {@link OperatePolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#operate} as well as {@link Client#append}, {@link Client#prepend} and {@link Client#add}.
 * * {@link QueryPolicy} - Applies to {@link Query#apply}, {@link Query#background} and {@link Query#foreach}.
 * * {@link ReadPolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#exists}, {@link Client#get} and {@link Client#select}.
 * * {@link RemovePolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#remove}.
 * * {@link ScanPolicy} - Applies to {@link Scan#background} and {@link Scan#foreach}.
 * * {@link WritePolicy} - Applies to {@link Client#put}.
 *
 * All client policy classes are derives from the common {@link BasePolicy}
 * class which defines common policy values that apply to all database
 * operations (except `InfoPolicy`, `MapPolicy` and `ListPolicy`).
 *
 * This module also defines global values for the following policy settings:
 *
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.commitLevel|commitLevel} - Specifies the
 * number of replicas required to be successfully committed before returning
 * success in a write operation to provide the desired consistency guarantee.
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.consistencyLevel|consistencyLevel} -
 * Specifies the number of replicas to be consulted in a read operation to
 * provide the desired consistency guarantee.
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.exists|exists} - Specifies the behavior for
 * writing the record depending whether or not it exists.
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.gen|gen} - Specifies the behavior of record
 * modifications with regard to the generation value.
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.key|key} - Specifies the behavior for
 * whether keys or digests should be sent to the cluster.
 * * {@link module:aerospike/policy.replica|replica} - Specifies which
 * partition replica to read from.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * const Aerospike = require('aerospike')
 *
 * // Set default policies for read and write commands
 * let defaults = {
 *   socketTimeout: 50,
 *   totalTimeout: 100
 * }
 * let config = {
 *   policies: {
 *     read: new Aerospike.ReadPolicy(defaults)
 *     write: new Aerospike.WritePolicy(defaults)
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * let key = new Aerospike.Key('test', 'demo', 'k1')
 *
 * Aerospike.connect(config)
 *   .then(client => {
 *     let record = {i: 1234}
 *
 *     // Override policy for put command
 *     let policy = new Aerospike.policy.WritePolicy({
 *       exists: Aerospike.policy.exists.CREATE,
 *       key: Aerospike.policy.key.SEND
 *     })
 *
 *     return client.put(key, record, {}, policy)
 *       .then(() => client.close())
 *       .catch(error => {
 *         client.close()
 *         if (error.code === Aerospike.status.ERR_RECORD_EXISTS) {
 *           console.info('record already exists')
 *         } else {
 *           return Promise.reject(error)
 *         }
 *       })
 *   })
 *   .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error))

 *
 * @property SEND - Send the key, in addition to the digest value. If you want
 * keys to be returned when scanning or querying, the keys must be stored on
 * the server. This policy causes a write operation to store the key. Once the
 * key is stored, the server will keep it - there is no need to use this policy
 * on subsequent updates of the record. If this policy is used on read or
 * delete operations, or on subsequent updates of a record with a stored key,
 * the key sent will be compared with the key stored on the server. A mismatch
 * will cause <code>ERR_RECORD_KEY_MISMATCH</code> to be returned.
